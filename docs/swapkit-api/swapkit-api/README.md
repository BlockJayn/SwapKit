# âš™ SwapKit API

The SwapKit API by THORSwap is a cutting-edge quote and routing API for cross-chain swaps. Our comprehensive solution enables you to swap assets across a variety of blockchains, in a totally decentralised manner. Our robust API links decentralised exchanges (DEXs), and DEX aggregators, to provide the absolute best possible quote for your trade. Explore our API, the best solution for trading **native Bitcoin,** without the need for a centralised custodian.

The SwapKit API also offers a variety of endpoints specifically for integration with THORChain. This includes, and is not limited to:

* THORChain pool details.
* Add/Remove liquidity to THORChain.
* Suggested gas prices for all supported chains.
* Token info with prices using chain oracles.
* Gas history for all supported chains.
* Cross-chain transaction tracking.
* Thorname registration & lookups.
